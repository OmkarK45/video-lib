		"description": "In Theaters Only March 26\nhttps://www.nobody.movie\n\nSometimes the man you don‚Äôt notice is the most dangerous of all. \n\nEmmy winner Bob Odenkirk (Better Call Saul, The Post, Nebraska) stars as Hutch Mansell, an underestimated and overlooked dad and husband, taking life‚Äôs indignities on the chin and never pushing back. A nobody.  \nWhen two thieves break into his suburban home one night, Hutch declines to defend himself or his family, hoping to prevent serious violence. His teenage son, Blake (Gage Munroe, The Shack), is disappointed in him and his wife, Becca (Connie Nielsen, Wonder Woman), seems to pull only further away.\n \nThe aftermath of the incident strikes a match to Hutch‚Äôs long-simmering rage, triggering dormant instincts and propelling him on a brutal path that will surface dark secrets and lethal skills. In a barrage of fists, gunfire and squealing tires, Hutch must save his family from a dangerous adversary (famed Russian actor Aleksey Serebryakov, Amazon‚Äôs McMafia)‚Äîand ensure that he will never be underestimated as a nobody again.\n\nNobody is directed by acclaimed filmmaker Ilya Naishuller (Hardcore Henry), from a script by Derek Kolstad, the narrative architect of the John Wick franchise, and co-stars legendary Emmy winner Christopher Lloyd as Hutch‚Äôs father and multi-hyphenate musician-actor RZA as Hutch‚Äôs brother, whose own hidden talents aid Hutch in his quest for vengeance.  \n\nThe film is produced by Kelly McCormick, p.g.a, and David Leitch, p.g.a., the filmmakers of Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw, Deadpool 2 and Atomic Blonde, for their company 87North, by Braden Aftergood, p.g.a. (Hell or High Water, Wind River), for his Eighty Two Films, and by Bob Odenkirk and Marc Provissiero (Hulu‚Äôs PEN15) for Odenkirk Provissiero Entertainment. The film is executive produced by Derek Kolstad, Marc S. Fischer, Annie Marter and Tobey Maguire.",

Subscribe!\n‚ñ∫ http://bit.ly/2NyxDcI\n\nWe also post cool stuff & updates on Instagram! Follow\n‚ñ∫ http://bit.ly/2HHjbeT\n\nThe inspiration behind this video: \n\nThor could end up defeating Gorr the God Butcher with the help of variants in Thor: Love and Thunder, copying the variant trick seen in Loki. The Marvel multiverse has been growing in prominence throughout the MCU‚Äôs Phase 4. Other universes and their respective iterations of Marvel characters were key to the premises of Loki and Marvel‚Äôs What If‚Ä¶?, and will continue to be essential aspects of the upcoming Spider-Man: No Way Home and Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness. With Christian Bale cast as Gorr the God Butcher, Love and Thunder may be a loose adaptation of Jason Aaron's Thor: God of Thunder comics, which featured multiple Thor iterations from across time and space, giving the film a perfect opportunity to include variants of the God of Thunder.\n\nWith the mainstream MCU‚Äôs Loki having died in Avengers: Infinity War, a Loki variant who was created by The Avengers‚Äô timeline meddling in Avengers: Endgame, stars in the Loki Disney+ series. Throughout his mind-bending multiverse misadventures, Loki teams up with other Loki variants, such as Sylvie, an older version of himself, and even Loki as an alligator. By the end of the series, the TVA‚Äôs secretive leader, Nathanial Richards (‚ÄúHe Who Remains‚Äù) is killed, opening the floodgates to dangerous Multiversal threats, such as Kang the Conqueror. While the original MCU version of Loki is dead, the 2012 variant seen in Loki could return, if the MCU needs Loki once again.\n\nThank You So Much For Watching!\nStay Tuned!
